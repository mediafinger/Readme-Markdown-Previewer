Readme Markdown Previewer
====
Readme Markdown Previewer allows you to quickly and easily preview your README.md using GitHub's styles. The page simply loads the readme.md file, converts it using a Showdown script, then previews it in a sample GitHub project page.

#### Usage

Simply download 'preview.html' to the root of your project and point your browser to preview.html.

The default is to load "readme.md" from the current directory. To load a file with a different name or path, pass the filename in the querystring.

http://localhost/markdown-preview/preview.html?readme=/path/ot/file/readme.markdown
